### Lecture 25 - Your project. Deep Learning

Deep Learning... In this lecture I would like to esplore with you the DeepLearning we can do with H2O package in R...

#### Learning to do Deep Learning

Inspired from (https://dzone.com/articles/anomaly-detection-with-deep-learning-in-r-with-h2o)[https://dzone.com/articles/anomaly-detection-with-deep-learning-in-r-with-h2o]

Also used: (https://dzone.com/articles/the-basics-of-deep-learning-how-to-apply-it-to-pre?fromrel=true)[https://dzone.com/articles/the-basics-of-deep-learning-how-to-apply-it-to-pre?fromrel=true]

And: (https://shiring.github.io/machine_learning/2017/05/01/fraud)[https://shiring.github.io/machine_learning/2017/05/01/fraud]

In this lecture we would explore the 'technology' on the sample and try to do this in 10 min lecture!

##### Understanding architecture

The 'Thing' will be working on your computer. In fact you will install another 'computer' inside your 'computer'...

##### Installing from R and starting it up


These instructions I got from: (http://h2o.ai/download/)[http://h2o.ai/download/]. Simply use 'Install from R' option

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# The following two commands will remove any previously installed H2O packages for R.
if ("package:h2o" %in% search()) { detach("package:h2o", unload=TRUE) }
if ("h2o" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) { remove.packages("h2o") }

# Next, we download packages that H2O depends on.
pkgs <- c("statmod","RCurl","jsonlite")
for (pkg in pkgs) {
if (! (pkg %in% rownames(installed.packages()))) { install.packages(pkg) }
}

# Now we download, install and initialize the H2O package for R.
install.packages("h2o", type="source", repos="http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-weierstrass/7/R")

# Finally, let's load H2O and start up an H2O cluster
library(h2o)
h2o.init()
```

As you see this will actually start the 'cluster' on our machine! We will now can look on `Localhost:54321` to see the 'interface' of our cluster...

As a trial let's learn how to shut down the machine...

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# we can shut down the 'machine' like this...
h2o.shutdown(prompt= FALSE)
```

# Explore the thing on 'example'

We will now run the demo from H2O. First thing we will launch the machine again...

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# to load the library
library(h2o)

# to initialize the 'machine'
h2o.init()
```

Then we will download the datasets from h2o.

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# Import ECG train and test data into the H2O cluster
train_ecg <- h2o.importFile(
 path = "http://h2o-public-test-data.s3.amazonaws.com/smalldata/anomaly/ecg_discord_train.csv", 
 header = FALSE, 
 sep = ",")
test_ecg <- h2o.importFile(
 path = "http://h2o-public-test-data.s3.amazonaws.com/smalldata/anomaly/ecg_discord_test.csv", 
 header = FALSE, 
 sep = ",")
```

Personally I like to know what is in the data and how it look like!!! I will just use this link and put it into the browser. This will download the files with raw data. If I open this dataset it would not tell me much! I will plot this data in excel...

**Train data set**
![Train Data][id1]

**Test data set**
![Test Data][id2]


Now, once we know how our data looks like we can start to do our Anomaly Model

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}


# Train deep autoencoder learning model on "normal" 
# training data, y ignored 
anomaly_model <- h2o.deeplearning(
 x = names(train_ecg), 
 training_frame = train_ecg, 
 activation = "Tanh", 
 autoencoder = TRUE, 
 hidden = c(50,20,50), 
 sparse = TRUE,
 l1 = 1e-4, 
 epochs = 100)
# Compute reconstruction error with the Anomaly 
# detection app (MSE between output and input layers)
recon_error <- h2o.anomaly(anomaly_model, test_ecg)

# Pull reconstruction error data into R and 
# plot to find outliers (last 3 heartbeats)
recon_error <- as.data.frame(recon_error)
recon_error
plot.ts(recon_error)
# Note: Testing = Reconstructing the test dataset
test_recon <- h2o.predict(anomaly_model, test_ecg) 
head(test_recon)
h2o.saveModel(anomaly_model, "C:/Users/fxtrams/Downloads/tmp/anomaly_model.bin")
h2o.download_pojo(anomaly_model, "C:/Users/fxtrams/Downloads/tmp", get_jar = TRUE)
h2o.shutdown(prompt= FALSE)

```
